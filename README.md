Based on Michael Mauboussin's book, The Success Equation, compared to Football (American and actual), Hockey, and Baseball, Basketball is the most 'skill-based'
sport. Outcomes and victories in Basketball are more representative of the difference between the skills and talents of the winners and the losers. This project
seeks to accurately predict NBA championships using Neural Net(s). It also includes a webscraper .py file, which can be used to change the training & test datasets.
